# Sales Graph
# Project: Dashboard Vue 3 with Vite

This project is a web application developed with **Vue 3** and **Vite**, leveraging a modern and efficient stack to create an interactive dashboard. The interface is built with **Pug** for simpler template writing, **Tailwind CSS** for rapid styling, and various libraries for additional functionality, such as **Element Plus** for UI components, **Chart.js** for charts, **Vue-Leaflet** for maps, and **axios** for API integration. A local server using json-server is configured to serve mocked data.
